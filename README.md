# programming
- We used Express to make HTTP requests
- We used EJS as our template engine.
- We used bootstrap for some style and a lot of css.
- Data is saved in array of JSONS

# problems 

- We were unable to link an external script to the HTML file no matter how hard we tried.
We solved the CSS external file problem with static files but it didn't work for the JS file.
- Full Disclosure - our home page made from zero but for the add and update screen we took great inspiration from our lecturer's library's project due to time constrains.

Hope you enjoy our site
